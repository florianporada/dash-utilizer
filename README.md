# dash-utilizer

this little project aims to make the amazon dash button better.

at this point it has a ifttt components where you can trigger a event by pressing the dash button.

to start the project just rename the `config.sample.js` and add the required data.

the basic functionality is, that the program listens to the button press and sends a predefined event to the `ifttt` service.

in the future there will be more services to interact with and hopefully a short- long- pattern press for the button to distinguish different functions.
